/*
  TASK 4 - NFT locker
  Implement a smart contract that will lock NFT for a period of time specified by the owner.
  Smart conrtact should contain logic to process following messages and getters: 

  Messages: 
  * OwnershipAssigned
   - Recives nft + time (in a forwardPayload message as uint32) for which this nft will be locked + address of the sender of the nft (prevOwner).
   - If the smart contract already holds an nft then return the incoming nft back to the sender
  * NftWithdrawal
   - Request withdrawal of the locked nft
   - If sender is not the owner (that came from OwnershipAssigned as prevOwner address) then throw "Invalid sender" 
   - If time has not passed then send message back to the sender with the comment "NFT is still locked" according to the TON's "message with text comment" standard 
   - Otherwise (all good) send the locked nft back to the owner with all the remainings of the incoming TONs
   Note that the order of checks is important
   (in case: "sender is not the owner" and "time has not passed" at the same time, "Invalid sender" error takes priority)

  Getters:
  * time
   - get how much lock time is left
  * nft
   - get the address of the locked nft 
  * owner
   - get the owner of the locked nft (that came from OwnershipAssigned as prevOwner)
